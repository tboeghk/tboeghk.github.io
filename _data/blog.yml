  - title: Synthetic response and uptime monitoring using the Prometheus Blackbox Exporter

    excerpt: |
      In e-commerce, response time is king. Regarding onsite search engines,
      response time tends to increase linearly with the number of products
      sold in an online shop. In a recent project, we enhanced a
      Solr search engine to overcome this barrier. We used the Prometheus Blackbox Exporter
      for progress validation (and regression detection).

      One of the annoying things to deal with when it comes to Terraform infrastructure is
      Terraform state drift, which describes the mismatch between the configured Terraform
      resources and the infrastructure reality.
