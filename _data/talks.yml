        For this talk I joined forces with [@backstreetkiwi](https://www.nikolauswinter.de)
        and we're presenting our approach combining a shared nothing architecture with a
        centralized logging approach (German version).

  - name: "Workshop: Open Source Observability & Log Management f√ºr Container-Umgebungen"
    conference: DevOpsCon 2019
    conference_link: https://devopsconference.de
    date: December 2019

    abstract: |
        In this workshop we‚Äôll walk through the building blocks of a modern monitoring and observability infrastructure
        (e.g. Filebeat, Logstash, Graylog, Elastic, Prometheus, Grafana). We‚Äôll also shed light on other solutions like
        e.g. Loki and Kibana. We‚Äôll start off with a naked Kubernetes cluster, extending the monitoring capabilities step
        by step. We‚Äôll deploy typical monitoring targets like a Spring Boot application or a WordPress blog. Together
        we‚Äôll develop monitoring strategies for applications, ingresses and the surrounding container environment.

      Public cloud services have become a commodity asset in the past years.
      Shopping24 though is currently running all systems on pure bare metal.
      I‚Äôll lay out Shopping24‚Äôs move into the Amazon AWS cloud a few years
      back and our recent journey back into a classic datacenter. The
      bottom line for doing effective DevOps in both classic and cloud
      infrastructure is automatization.

  - name: Open Source Logging and Monitoring
    type: youtube
    conference: code.talks 2017, JAX 2017, W-JAX 2017
    conference_link: https://www.codetalks.de
    date: September 2017

      Logging und Monitoring sind kein sexy Thema. Niemand hat Lust, sich auf
      Konsolen einzuloggen und Logdateien zu durchforsten. In Docker-Umgebungen
      potenziert sich das Problem noch einmal. Ich zeige in dieser Session das Zusammenspiel
      aus Logstash und Graylog zur Access-Loganalyse, Sentry zum Exception
      Logging sowie Graphite und Grafana zur Visualisierung von Anwendungsmetriken.

  - name: Context Driven Search Ranking and Faceting
    type: youtube
    conference: Lucene/Solr Revolution 2017
    conference_link: https://activate-conf.com/
    date: September 2017

    abstract: |
      In e-commerce, when searching over a wide range of products, sorting your search
      result is crucial to your business. You most likely want to sort your search
      result depending on the search context - like the dominating category or the user's
      search or order history. We built a Solr plugin to determine the current category
      "in flight" and change sorting and facetting of the current query without adding
      any overhead to the query.

  - name: Ungef√§hr popul√§r ‚Äì Moderne Datenstrukturen im Einsatz
    type: speaker-deck
    conference: JAX 2017

      Mit Hadoop und diversen Streamingframeworks (Spark, Flink) steht ein ganzer
      Blumenstrau√ü an Tools bereit, um in (fast) Echtzeit auch gro√üe Datenmengen
      zu analysieren. Was aber wenn die ben√∂tigte Rechenleistung in keinem Verh√§ltnis zum
      Problem steht? Hier helfen moderne Datenstrukturen wie z. B. der Bloom-Filter
      oder der Count-Min Sketch. Diese speichern sehr gro√üe Datenmengen auf
      sehr kleinem Raum.
